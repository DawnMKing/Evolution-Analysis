%% exist_load.m
% [data,flag,error] = exist_load(data_name,flag,do_print)
% This function will attempt to load the data file passed to it, data_name.
% If successful, the data is loaded.
% Otherwise, an error message is displayed and the flag, which is boolean,
% will toggle to the opposing state of it's input value.
%
% This is a modified variation of try_catch_load (and even uses that
% function), but it makes use of the function mat_exist. If data_name
% exists, then the data is loaded. If not, then the error is obtained by
% going through try_catch_load. The reason for this change is that
% try_catch_load tends to bog down execution times and can cause matlab to
% seemingly hang on the function. If there is an error, only then will
% there be a problem.
